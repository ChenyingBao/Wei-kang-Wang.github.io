## Abstract
In this paper, we aim to facilitate a deep neural net-work to do micro-expression recognition (MEF) task withhigh accuracy. Inspired by the fact that micro-expressionsare indeed subtle and very brief facial expressions, weadopt an adversarial learning framework that leveragesmacro-expression databases as privileged information toassist.  Due to the fact that the subjects in micro andmacro expression databases are different, we introducethe Expression-Identity Disentangle Network (EIDNet) asthe feature extractor to disentangle expression-related fea-tures apart from identity-related features.  Comprehen-sive experiments on the three public spontaneous micro-expression databases SMIC, CASME2 and SAMM showthat our method is state-of-the-art.
