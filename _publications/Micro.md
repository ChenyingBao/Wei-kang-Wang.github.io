## Abstract
In this paper, we aim to facilitate a deep neural net-work to do micro-expression recognition (MEF) task with high accuracy. Inspired by the fact that micro-expressions are indeed subtle and very brief facial expressions, we adopt an adversarial learning framework that leverages macro-expression databases as privileged information to assist.  Due to the fact that the subjects in micro and macro expression databases are different, we introduce the Expression-Identity Disentangle Network (EIDNet) as the feature extractor to disentangle expression-related features apart from identity-related features.  Comprehensive experiments on the three public spontaneous micro-expression databases SMIC, CASME2 and SAMM show that our method is state-of-the-art.
