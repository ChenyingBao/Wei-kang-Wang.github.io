Internship in Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Science
======
* [Center for Biometrics and Security Research (CBSR), National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition of China](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/index.asp), Beijing, CN, SEP./2016-NOV./2016
* Advisor: Dr. Stan Li.
* Merged Megaface datasets, MS-Celeb-1M datasets and CASIA Face Image database into the biggest
face datasets in the world at that time;
* Used CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to extract features of every identity in three data sets;
* Constructed evaluation matrix to evaluate the similarity of every two identities from two datasets in
order to merge the same identity.
  
A New VC Dimension Based on Probability
======
* [MACHINE PERCEPTION LAB](mpl.buaa.edu.cn), Beihang University, Beijing, CN, MAR./2016-Jun./2016
* Advisor: Professor B. Zhang
* We introduced a new VC dimension by considering the distribution of data sets, the range of confidence interval and the training error;
  * Put forward new VC bound based on probability;
  * Solved paradox between the range of confidence intervals and size of the hypothesis set.

Cooperative target searching and tracking via UCT with probability distribution model
======
* School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, CN, JUL./2015-Dec./2015
* Advisor: Dr. T. Wang
* We applied the knowledge of quantum mechanics into searching algorithm and proposed quantum probability model of UVAâ€™S searching and tracking algorithm;
  * Proposed a new searching and tracking algorithm and did experiments on it;
  * Set probability transfer rule (PTR) for the new algorithm and proved the new model will still keep the probability distribution rule valid in theory.
