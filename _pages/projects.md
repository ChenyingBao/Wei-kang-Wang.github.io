Is sparse representation a good and profound explanation for face recognition?
======
* Columbia University, New York, NY, JAN./2018-MAY./2018
* Course project of Sparse Representation & High-dimensional Geometry
* Lecturer: Professor John Wright, Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University
* I confirmed that the sample space consisting of human face images with different illumination conditions and facial
expressions is indeed low-dimensional by calculating the singular values of sample matrix consisting of images
from one identity in AR database. By conducting comparison experiments on YaleB databases with area sparsed
corruptions, I showed that both collaborative representation and l1 norm minimization techniques proposed in the
Sparse-representation-based algorithm were essential for the performances.

Autonomous driving learning for single-agent problem with deep reinforcement learning methods
======
* Columbia University, New York, NY, JAN./2018-MAY./2018
* Course project of Reinforcement Learning
* Lecturer: Professor Chong Li, Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University
* Co-worker: Q. Zheng and M. Xu, Graduate Students of Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University
* We developed an deep neural network to learn approximate functions of value-action function of autonomous driving
problems. The traditional methods for learning value-action function like Q-learning or TD-learning are too space
and time consuming thus not practical. We implemented the powerful learning ability of deep network to learn the
approximation of the value-action function in order for more ecient autonomous driving systems.

Data Mining: Customer Reviews of Hotels
======
* Columbia University, New York, NY, JAN./2018-MAY./2018
* Course project of Statistical Learning
* Lecturer: Professor Predrag Jelenkovic, Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University
* We adopted classical machine learning methods including naive Bayes classifer, decision tree and support vector
machine to do a regression problem which outputs a rating value based on customer's several inputs. Sensitivity
analysis was also conducted in the project. Theoretically analysis oered a clearer and deeper understanding of
statistical machine learning tools.
  
Multi-Digits Recognition based on CNN
======
* Columbia University, New York, NY, SEP./2017-DEC./2017
* Course project of Neural Network & Deep Learning
* Lecturer: Professor Zoran Kostic, Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University
* Co-worker: J. Li, Graduate Student of Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University
* We built a CNN can identify length-changed multi-digits in original input images with high accuracy. A mixture
probability model is used to represent the length of digits and every identity of those digits. We trained and tested
our framework with The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Database and got a 73:998% testing accuracy.  
  
Emotion Detector Machine
======
* Columbia University, New York, NY, SEP./2017-DEC./2017
* Course project of Digital Signal Processing
* Lecturer: Professor John Wright, Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University
* Co-worker: Q. Zheng, M. Li and J. Peng, Graduate Students of Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Columbia University
* We analyzed the recognition ability of facial expressions with different feature extractors including HOG, CNN,
and different classiffiers, including KNN, SVM. Recognition accuracy comparisons between original features and
dimension reduced features by PCA were also analyzed in our project.

Face recognition based on deep learning and embedded platform (Undergraduate thesis)
======
* Beihang University, Beijing, CN, SEP./2016-JUN./2017
* Advisor: Professor B. Zhang, School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University
* I designed an embedded face recognition system which can capture, preprocess and identify human faces efficiently
in an embedded system. Our system combined face image detection, image preprocessing and face identification.
The inner structure is VGG19 and fine-tuned to adapt in our problem. We pretrained our network and then encode
the framework into an embedded system for recognition tasks. This can be used as sign-in machine by identifying
human identities effciently.
